  <h2>2. Purpose of Data Access</h2>
  <p>The sole purpose of accessing your Google Drive is to safely store and restore backup files related to the Applications.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not store, share, or transmit your data outside of your Google Drive. All backup files remain under your control within your Google Drive account.</p>

  <h2>4. Revoking Access</h2>
  <p>You may revoke the Applicationsâ€™ access to your Google Drive at any time by visiting:</p>
